Jan Document Plugin - Pre-Installation Information
==================================================

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Jan Document Plugin adds document understanding to Jan AI.
Upload PDFs, Word docs, Excel files, and images - then chat
about their contents using your local LLM.

Everything runs 100% offline. Your documents never leave
your computer.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Windows 10 or Windows 11 (64-bit)
- Jan AI installed and running (https://jan.ai)
- 2GB free disk space
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)


OPTIONAL: OCR FOR SCANNED DOCUMENTS
-----------------------------------
To extract text from scanned PDFs and images, install
Tesseract OCR after setup:

  winget install UB-Mannheim.TesseractOCR

Or download from:
  https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki


HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. Start Jan AI and enable Local API Server
2. Launch Jan Document Plugin
3. Upload documents via the web interface (localhost:1338)
4. Chat with your documents in Jan!

The plugin runs as a local proxy between you and Jan,
automatically injecting relevant document context into
your conversations.
